    <h2>What is the Challenge?</h2>
    <ol class="Circle-numbers row">
      <li class="columns small-12 large-6 ">
        <p>It’s easy. Set a timer on your phone for 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes. Your choice! Challenge whoever you’re with (friends, family, co-workers) to do the same.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="columns small-12 large-6">
        <p>Turn your phone down on the table. Don’t cheat! Give yourself that time to disconnect from your device and technology to enjoy the people you’re with (or quality time spent alone) and the food you’re eating (at home or in a restaurant). It’s simple, but it’s also a hard thing to do. You can do it! We believe in you.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="columns small-12 large-6">
        <p>The timer goes off. You feel amazing, calm and refreshed. Congratulations!</p>
      </li>
      <li class="columns small-12 large-6">
        <p>Share your experience with us on social media. Use the hashtag <strong>#DinnerMode</strong> and let us know how taking the challenge made you feel. Maybe you took a photo before you started or when it ended. Be creative! We can’t wait to see what you share.</p>

          #DinnerMode is the inspiration of <a href="http://thecausemopolitan.com/" target="_blank">Sloane Davidson</a>, an activist, digital communications professional, fundraiser and burgeoning farmer. She was inspired to start this movement this summer when she left technology behind to go volunteer on a farm in upstate New York following the sudden and tragic death of her best friend. She had an aha moment when these five critical things came together:</p>

    <ol class="Serif-numbers columns small-12 medium-10 medium-centered large-8 large-centered">
      <li>We are becoming increasingly addicted to our devices. We go from work or school with computers to sitting at dinner still looking at our phones without giving ourselves a break.</li>
      <li>We are not living in the moment or appreciating the beauty of life when we’re always rushing to the next thing.</li>
      <li>There is a push towards mindfulness, but not everyone meditates or does yoga. How can we get people thinking about being intentional? What does everyone do regardless of their gender, race or class? Everyone eats.</li>
      <li>We aren’t paying attention to the food in front of us because we’re busy texting, sending emails, taking photos and posting to social media. But food is more important than ever. Obesity is on the rise in America but so are farmer’s markets and sustainable food. What message could reach all parts of America and resonate? How can people stop to think and appreciate the food in front of them and what kind of self-reflection will that create?</li>
      <li>Not everyone has been on an airplane or flies regularly. Airplane Mode doesn’t resonate with every audience, the idea of turning your phone off for a period of time. Eating is something everyone does, regardless of status. How can we apply the base principles of Airplane Mode to food?</li>

        <p>She took those thoughts and asked herself the question...what if there was a movement, a challenge, an idea where people put down their phones for dinner? We used to do it. Some still do. What if we created a zone where we didn’t have to be uber-connected even for a short period of time and we could instead enjoy the people they’re with and the food in front of them? Would we eat slower or eat less and feel better afterwards? Would we thrive on that human connection and interaction? Would it refuel creativity and thoughtfulness? Would that intention bleed to other parts of our lives?</p>
